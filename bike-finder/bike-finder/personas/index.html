<h2> Needs Transportation </h2>

<p> Sam is in his mid-20s and a recent grad. He lives in Portland. He has been working in a Marketing Department for 2 years and he earns 50K/year. It takes him 30 minutes to walk to work but only 8 minutes to bike. Although, the hilly terrain makes the commute somewhat difficult. His bike got stolen awhile ago and he been saving money for a new bike. He needs a bike as soon as possible because winter is coming soon. Sam also lives on the 4th floor of a small apartment with one other roommate. Unfortunately, there's no elevator in the apartment. </p>

<p> Sam is in average shape but doesn't work out. He values efficiency and is frugal. While he wants a bike now, he sees himself buying a car in the upcoming years. He has intermediate knowledge of bikes. He can differentiate different types of bikes, knows how to shift gears, and understands basic concept of bike. As a millennial, Sam is good at using technology. </p>
